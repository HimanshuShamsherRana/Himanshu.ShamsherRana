                <h3 id="History">History</h3>
                <p>Football in Nepal had been a national sport as early as 1921 during the Rana dynasty. Several clubs
                    were formed and several domestic tournaments such as the Ram Janaki Cup (1934), and the Tribhuvan
                    Challenge Shield (1948) were organized. In 1951, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) was
                    founded, and this saw the formation of the Nepal national football team.</p>

                <h3 id="Golden generation">Golden Generation</h3>
                <p>In 1970, Nepal became a member of FIFA. Two years later, Nepal joined the Asian Football
                    Confederation (AFC). With this, Nepal played their first international match on 13 October 1972,
                    where they lost 2–6 to the People's Republic of China. The first Nepali footballer to score the
                    first international goal for Nepal in a FIFA-recognized tournament was Y.B Ghale. Ghale scored
                    against Kuwait in the 1982 Asian Games. Despite the popularity of the game, the lack of appropriate
                    footballing infrastructure and the dearth of trainers, technicians, and other facilities have always
                    been obstacles in the way of the Nepali FA's endeavors to raise the standard of football among the
                    players of a nation that has an official per capita income of just 1,196 US dollars. The woes of
                    Nepali football, however, have been immensely relieved by FIFA's determination to promote football
                    in Nepal through youth programs.</p>

                <h3 id="Home Stadium">Home Stadium</h3>
                <p>The team's home ground is various around the nation one of the ground being Dasarath Rangasala
                    Stadium, a multi-purpose stadium in Kathmandu, Nepal. Holding 15,000 spectators all of which are
                    beautifully seated.[15] It is the biggest stadium in Nepal. It is named after Dashrath Chand, one of
                    the martyrs of Nepal.

                    Most recently, the stadium was used as a primary venue for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup and the 2013
                    SAFF Championship, with the Halchowk Stadium hosting some of the matches as well.

                    Apart from sporting events, the stadium is also used as a music venue for cultural events with Bryan
                    Adams being the most notable act that performed at the site.

                    Before the 2013 SAFF Championship in Nepal, the stadium underwent a heavy renovation that saw
                    several improvements such as the expansion of seats from 20,000 to 28,000.

                    The country also has some recently added stadiums that include Pokhara football stadium located at
                    Pokhara Rangasala which has recently been constructed in 2021.</p>

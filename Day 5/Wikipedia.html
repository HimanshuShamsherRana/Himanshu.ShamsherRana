    <h1>History</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Origins(1921-1993)</h2>
    <p><a href="">Football in Nepal</a>had been a national sport as early as 1921 during the<br> <a href="">Rana Dynasty</a>. Several clubs were formed and several domestic<br> tournaments such as the Ram Janaki Cup (1934), and the <a href="">Tribhuvan Challenge Cup</a><br> (1948) were organized. In 1951, the All Nepal Football <br>Association (ANFA) was founded, and this saw the formation of the Nepal national football team.

     <h2>Emergence(1963-1970)</h2>
     <p>In 1963, Nepal appeared in their first international away game in the Aga<br>Khan Gold Cup; the predecessor of the President's Gold Cup, Asia<br> Champion Club Tournament, and <a href="">Asian Club Championship</a> (now <br>rebranded as the <a href="">AFC Champions League</a>) after various associations<br> (including <a href="">ANFA</a>) insisted on entering national teams instead of clubs.[3]<br> After Nepal entered an 18-man squad, ANFA flew the players to Dhaka,<br> <a href="">East Pakistan</a>(now <a href="">Bangladesh</a>) to play their first match. Nepal faced<br> Western Railway, a Pakistani team in the Bangabandhu National Stadium.<br> However, Nepal lost the match 0–7. Two days later, Nepal played the <br>Dhaka Wanderers, a local East Pakistani team. This match was also lost 0–7.<br> After two disastrous games, Nepal was sure to be knocked out of the<br> preliminary round. The final game was against Dhaka Police Club, though,<br> despite the previous heavy losses, Nepal managed to win the game with <br>a single goal, Prakash Bikram Shah becoming the first Nepali to score on<br> foreign soil. The goal was scored in the 19th minute.</p>
